Heyy!!
I am Mohammed Adil. I am currently working as a 'RTL Design and Verification Engineer'. 

Well let's talk about my personality :)
I am a sensitive, understanding and supportive person.I think I'm  friendly and approachable, if you know me you might agree.


The guide provided at this blog will take you on a journey of discovery, teaching you the very basics and advance concepts of Digital Design using verilog hdl, the fundamentals of SystemVerilog for verification, UVM, concepts of Linux, and much more!

It is our intent to provide a wiki of sorts, where users of any skill level can easily find relevant information for their verification projects.
