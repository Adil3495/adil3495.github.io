We will be designing three digital circuits on a piece of paper and than coding it in verilog. We will be using only three basic components to design the circuits. Vectored adder, vectored mux and vectored comparator. Using this method it is really easy to visualize the code as well as the design.
 - 4:2 MSB Priority Encoder.
 - Selecting Maximum and Minimum values from two n-bit numbers.
 - Generating next seconds for a watch.
