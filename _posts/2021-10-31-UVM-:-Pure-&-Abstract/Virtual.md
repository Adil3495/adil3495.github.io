###### What is Abstract class or Virtual class ?
 - A class which is defined as virtual is called abstract class. A set of classes may be created that can be viewed as all beign derived from a common base class. An object of an abstract class shall not be constructed directly.
###### What are Pure Virtual Methods in class ?
 - A virtual method in an abstract class may be declared as a prototype without providing an implementation. This is called as pure together without providing a method body.
 - A extended subclass may provide an implementation by overriding the pure virtual method with a virtual method having a method body.
