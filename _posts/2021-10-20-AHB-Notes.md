# AHB Protocol Notes
## Agenda
 * Architecture
 * Components
 * Ports
 * Timing diagrams
 * Features
 * Interview questions

## Notes 
 1. Protocol Basics
 - set of guidelines which defines the communication between master and slave componets.
 2. Protocols: There are two types
	* on-chip
		- protocols which defines communication of components on the chip.
		- Data communication happnes in terms of transactions.
	* peripheral
		- protocols which defines communication of 
		components with the components outside the chip.
		- Data communication happnes in terms off packets/frames.
		- There is no limitation on the port size(fabrication technology is so advance that we can keep 1000 pins in mm (mili-meter) space or even lesser space)
		- limited by the avilable area, we can't use too many port.
			ex: imagine a 40 port USB pendrive (generally it will have 4 wire, V+, GND, D+, D-)
 3. AHB Basics 
	* ARM Propeietry protocol 
		* All ARM processors will be either based on AXI or AHB 
	* Interconnect is used for connecting multiple master to multiple slaves
	* AHB based system architecture has below components 
		* Masters
		* Slaves
		* Interconnect
	* Interconnect acts like a slave for AHB Master connection
	* Interconnect acts like a master for AHB slave connection
	* Interconnect routes the master requets to the target slave, routes the slaves responses to the correct master.
	* AHB Interconnect is made up of decoder + multiplexer logic
		* It decodes incomming requests address, figures out in which direction request should be routed.
		* It automaticaly knows in which direction response should be routed.
			* automatically: at any time 1master-1salve connection got established, so interconnect knows which master is active now.
