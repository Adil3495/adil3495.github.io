Useful FPGA / FPGA Resources

(useful FPGA resources)

Anyone can help in compiling a list of useful information resources on FPGA / FPGA topics - sites, youtube channels, development tools, books, debug boards, etc.

(Everyone can help in compiling a list of useful information resources on the subject of FPGA - web sites, youtube channels, development tools, books, debugging boards, and so on.)

You can add data to the list, suggest categories and improve the usability of the list through a pull request or by writing to admin@fpga-systems.ru or in a personal message in telegram @ KeisN13
